# How to Become a Data Scientist

## How to use this instruction:
This instruction collected a series of online courses and books that can help you to advance your knowledge in this area without wondering around about the sources you need to study.

The first part of instruction is designed for thr people with a itroductary background in statistics and programming (e.g. Math and Engineering Graduates).

The second part in for the people who wants to have seeper understanding of mathematics of Machine Learning.

The third part is devoted to the more advanced tools like Deep Learning, RNN, CNN, XGBoost, and etc.

I rated the sources difficulties from 1- easy to 5 -hard.
###Note:
If you do not have any cs background I highly recommend to take look at a Data Structure and Algorithm course and if you dont have a statuscal backgrond an introductry course in statistics can be very helpful.
